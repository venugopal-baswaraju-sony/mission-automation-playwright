                        <h3>What is a percentage?</h3>
                        <p>Percentage is a way of expressing a number as a fraction of 100. It is commonly used to
                            represent a portion of a whole or to compare two numbers. Percentages are often denoted with
                            the symbol "%". For example, if there are 100 cars in a garage and 25 of them are white, we
                            could say that 25% of the cars in the garage are white.</p>
